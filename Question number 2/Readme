2- I did not understand what you meant by this question, If the purpose of security is to use the SSH protocol, we can use the following methods: 
We have several solutions to secure our SSH connection:
1-	As an immediately work, we need to change Default SSH port from 22 to custom port.
For change this port we must edit ssh config file in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and change “Port 22” section to custom number of port that we want to set.
2-	Use SSH key instead of password
Actually, using a password is not secure way to connect server. We can use Certificate to create security and limited access of each user to the server. 

We use the following method to create a certificate:
Generate certificate with ssh-keygen command on host (in this method we can use another location for save Public and Private Key) 
•	The most important thing is that we must use a password for our certificate
      Copy public key to another server with ssh-copy-id command 
•	Use it like this command:  ssh-copy-id [-i identity file] [-p port] [user]@hostname
3-	Two-step authentication method
	In this method, we can use the combination of two methods of password and verification by 	sending an SMS to the mobile phone or sending an email.
	In this method we can used PAM (Google Authenticator) for install this module:
	sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
To make SSH use the Google Authenticator PAM module, add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/sshd file:
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
	Now you need to restart the sshd daemon
	After that we must to modify ChallengeResponseAuthentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, 	change status from No to Yes.	
But if the purpose is to hide the IP of the servers and not to access them from outside the network, we use the following methods.
The above mentioned methods to secure the connection through SSH, but what we need to do to achieve the highest level of security is to use one of the following 2 methods:
1-	SSH into the private server through Bastion Host
2-
